# Analysis of the Design

To secure the CI/CD pipeline for the VAmPI application, we will implement automated security checks using GitHub Actions. The focus will be on integrating Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Software Composition Analysis (SCA), and secret scanning to identify vulnerabilities early in the development process.

## Key Components:

### Static Application Security Testing (SAST):

#### Tools:
Bandit and Semgrep.
#### Purpose:
Analyze source code to detect security issues such as injection flaws, insecure configurations, and other common vulnerabilities.

### Software Composition Analysis (SCA):

#### Tool:
Safety.
#### Purpose:
Scan dependencies specified in requirements.txt for known vulnerabilities.

### Secret Scanning:

#### Tool:
TruffleHog.
#### Implementation:
Pre-commit Hooks:

Use the pre-commit framework to set up TruffleHog hooks, preventing secrets from being committed.

CI Integration:

Run TruffleHog in the CI pipeline to catch any secrets that might have bypassed pre-commit checks.

## Pipeline Design:

### Trigger:
The workflow will be triggered on pull requests to the main branch.
### Jobs:
A single job named security_scans will run all security checks sequentially for simplicity.
#### Environment:
Use the latest stable versions of tools and Python to ensure compatibility and up-to-date vulnerability databases.
### Failure Criteria:
The pipeline will fail if any high or critical vulnerabilities are found, enforcing a security-first approach.
### Output:
Detailed reports from each tool to aid in remediation efforts.
