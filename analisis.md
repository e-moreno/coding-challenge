# Analysis of the Design

To secure the CI/CD pipeline for the VAmPI application, we will implement automated security checks using GitHub Actions. The focus will be on integrating Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Software Composition Analysis (SCA), and secret scanning to identify vulnerabilities early in the development process.

## Key Components:

### Static Application Security Testing (SAST):

#### Tools:
Bandit and Semgrep.
#### Purpose:
Analyze source code to detect security issues such as injection flaws, insecure configurations, and other common vulnerabilities.

### Software Composition Analysis (SCA):

#### Tool:
Safety.
#### Purpose:
Scan dependencies specified in requirements.txt for known vulnerabilities.

### Secret Scanning:

#### Tool:
TruffleHog.
#### Implementation:
Pre-commit Hooks:

Use the pre-commit framework to set up TruffleHog hooks, preventing secrets from being committed.

CI Integration:

Run TruffleHog in the CI pipeline to catch any secrets that might have bypassed pre-commit checks.

## Pipeline Design:

### Trigger:
The workflow will be triggered on pull requests to the main branch.
### Jobs:
A single job named security_scans will run all security checks sequentially for simplicity.
#### Environment:
Use the latest stable versions of tools and Python to ensure compatibility and up-to-date vulnerability databases.
### Failure Criteria:
The pipeline will fail if any high or critical vulnerabilities are found, enforcing a security-first approach.
### Output:
Detailed reports from each tool to aid in remediation efforts.

### Explanation of the Workflow Steps

#### Checkout code:
Uses the actions/checkout@v3 action to clone the repository.
#### Set up Python:
Sets up the Python environment using actions/setup-python@v4 with the latest Python 3.x version.
#### Install Dependencies and Tools:
Upgrades pip, installs project dependencies from requirements.txt, and installs security tools (bandit, safety, truffleHog, semgrep).
#### Run Bandit:
Executes Bandit to scan the codebase, focusing on high-severity and high-confidence issues.
#### Run Safety:
Performs SCA using Safety, generating a full report of vulnerable dependencies.
#### Run Semgrep:
Runs Semgrep using the recommended CI ruleset (p/ci), which includes a comprehensive set of security checks.
#### Run TruffleHog:
Scans the repository for secrets and sensitive information.

### Notes

continue-on-error: false: Ensures the workflow fails if any step detects vulnerabilities, enforcing strict security checks.
Simplification: Combining all scans into a single job keeps the workflow clean and manageable.
Semgrep Configuration: The p/ci configuration is a pre-defined set of rules suitable for CI environments, focusing on security best practices.

### Instructions for Developers

1. Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git

2. Navigate to the Repository Directory

    ```bash
    cd your-repo
    ```

3. Install Pre-commit

    ```bash
    pip install pre-commit
    ```

4. Install the Pre-commit Hooks

    ```bash
    pre-commit install
    ```
    
    This command sets up the pre-commit hooks to run automatically before each commit.

5. (Optional) Run Pre-commit on All Files

    To check all files in the repository immediately (useful when setting up pre-commit for the first time), run:

    ```bash
    pre-commit run --all-files
    ```

6. Start Developing

    You can now work on the code as usual. Before each commit, the configured hooks will run to check for secrets, code issues, and more.
